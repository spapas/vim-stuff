Some help for plugins I use

easymotion/vim-easymotion
-------------------------

<leader><leader>motion mark to jump to a mark depending on motion. For example (notice I use space for leader so I'll write spsp):
spsp j: Select line below
spsp k: Select line above
spsp w/W: Select next word/WORD
spsp f/Fchar: Select character forwards/backwards
spsp schar: Select charater bidirectional

Notice that it has various default mappings over a single <leader> however I don't want to enable 'em to keep the single leader key for my own usage.

mbbill/undotree
---------------

Displays a tree for undo.

Use <leader>(sp)u to display - hide the tree. Then ctrl+w w to go to the undotree pane 

Things to remember: 

* The undo history is sorted based on the changes' timestamp. The year/month/day field will not be displayed if the changes were made within the same day.
* The change sequence number is displayed before timestamp.
* The current position is marked as >seq<.
* The next change that will be restored by :redo or <ctrl-r> is marked as {seq}, it's the same as curhead returned by undotree()
* The [seq] marks the last change and where further changes will be added, it's the same as newhead returned by undotree()
* Saved changes are marked as s and the capitalized S indicates the last saved change.

tpope/vim-surround
------------------

This adds a bunch of surround operators:

csxy: Change surround x to y, for example cs"{ will change "asd" to { asd }.  There is a funny thing with spaces so cs"} will change "asd" to {asd}.
dsx: Delete surround x, for example dst will change <p>koko</p> to koko.
ysmx: Will surround motion with surround x. For example ys3w" will change koko koko koko to "koko koko koko"

This also works with Visual mode (with capital S - lower s starts vim-sneak) but *not* with Visual Line mode; not sure why yet. 
Try this to surround a line with brackets: ^ys$[ or use yss[ "surround sentence" 

Some more info from the help:

Eight punctuation marks, (, ), {, }, [, ], <, and >, represent themselves
and their counterparts.  If the opening mark is used, contained whitespace is
also trimmed.  The targets b, B, r, and a are aliases for ), }, ], and > 
(the first two mirror Vim; the second two are completely arbitrary and
subject to change).

Three quote marks, ', ", `, represent themselves, in pairs.  They are only
searched for on the current line.

A t is a pair of HTML or XML tags.  See |tag-blocks| for details.  Remember
that you can specify a numerical argument if you want to get to a tag other
than the innermost one.

The letters w, W, and s correspond to a |word|, a |WORD|, and a |sentence|,
respectively.  These are special in that they have nothing to delete, and
used with |ds| they are a no-op.  With |cs|, one could consider them a
slight shortcut for ysi (cswb == ysiwb, more or less).

A p represents a |paragraph|.  This behaves similarly to w, W, and s above;
however, newlines are sometimes added and/or removed.

REPLACEMENTS                                    *surround-replacements*

A replacement argument is a single character, and is required by |cs|, |ys|,
and |vS|.  Undefined replacement characters (with the exception of alphabetic
characters) default to placing themselves at the beginning and end of the
destination, which can be useful for characters like / and |.

If either ), }, ], or > is used, the text is wrapped in the appropriate pair
of characters.  Similar behavior can be found with (, {, and [ (but not <),
which append an additional space to the inside.  Like with the targets above,
b, B, r, and a are aliases for ), }, ], and >.  To fulfill the common need for
code blocks in C-style languages, <C-}> (which is really <C-]>) adds braces on
lines separate from the content.

If t or < is used, Vim prompts for an HTML/XML tag to insert.  You may specify
attributes here and they will be stripped from the closing tag. If replacing a
tag, its attributes are kept in the new tag. End your input with > to discard
the those attributes. If <C-T> is used, the tags will appear on lines by
themselves.

If s is used, a leading but not trailing space is added.  This is useful for
removing parentheses from a function call with csbs.
