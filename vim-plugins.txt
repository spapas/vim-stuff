Some help for plugins I use

easymotion/vim-easymotion
-------------------------

<leader><leader>motion mark to jump to a mark depending on motion. For example (notice I use space for leader so I'll write spsp):
spsp j: Select line below
spsp k: Select line above
spsp w/W: Select next word/WORD
spsp f/Fchar: Select character forwards/backwards
spsp schar: Select charater bidirectional

Notice that it has various default mappings over a single <leader> however I don't want to enable 'em to keep the single leader key for my own usage.

mbbill/undotree
---------------

Displays a tree for undo.

Use <leader>(sp)u to display - hide the tree. Then ctrl+w w to go to the undotree pane 

Things to remember: 

* The undo history is sorted based on the changes' timestamp. The year/month/day field will not be displayed if the changes were made within the same day.
* The change sequence number is displayed before timestamp.
* The current position is marked as >seq<.
* The next change that will be restored by :redo or <ctrl-r> is marked as {seq}, it's the same as curhead returned by undotree()
* The [seq] marks the last change and where further changes will be added, it's the same as newhead returned by undotree()
* Saved changes are marked as s and the capitalized S indicates the last saved change.

tpope/vim-surround
------------------

This adds a bunch of surround operators:

csxy: Change surround x to y, for example cs"{ will change "asd" to { asd }.  There is a funny thing with spaces so cs"} will change "asd" to {asd}.
dsx: Delete surround x, for example dst will change <p>koko</p> to koko.
ysmx: Will surround motion with surround x. For example ys3w" will change koko koko koko to "koko koko koko"

This also works with Visual mode (with capital S - lower s starts vim-sneak) but *not* with Visual Line mode; not sure why yet. 
Try this to surround a line with brackets: ^ys$[
