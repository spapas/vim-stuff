Some help for plugins I use

easymotion/vim-easymotion
-------------------------

<leader><leader>motion mark to jump to a mark depending on motion. For example (notice I use space for leader so I'll write spsp):
spsp j: Select line below
spsp k: Select line above
spsp w/W: Select next word/WORD
spsp f/Fchar: Select character forwards/backwards
spsp schar: Select charater bidirectional

Notice that it has various default mappings over a single <leader> however I don't want to enable 'em to keep the single leader key for my own usage.
